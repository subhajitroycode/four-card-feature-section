## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- SCSS/SASS

### What I learned

I made this site to learn more about CSS Grid and CSS custom properties. I also used @mixin to make some of the properties reusable.


```css
@mixin bg-border($color, $url) {
  border-top: 5px solid $color;
  background: url($url) no-repeat top 120px left 205px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue to learn more about SCSS/SASS functions and mixins and how to use them to make my site more dynamic.
